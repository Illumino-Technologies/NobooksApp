## Intro
This feature is meant to show the details of data collected on the student over a certain period of time
<br>It could be grades, or analytics...etc

## Before you start
 - Go through the code in the following files:
   - [student.dart](../../global/domain/models/user/student/student.dart)
   - [user.dart](../../global/domain/models/user/user.dart)
   - [subject.dart](../../global/domain/models/subject/subject.dart)
   - [class.dart](../../global/domain/models/class/class.dart)
   - [school.dart](../../global/domain/models/school/school.dart)
 - Also since/if the backend/server is not ready, make use of the equivalent fakes for the classes listed above.
 - if it doesn't already exist, kindly create it in the appropriate directory.
